# SQuAD Filter

This folder contains the source code used to take 25%, 50% and 75% best translated SQuAD-format data based on a score file

## Requirements
	* Python 3.x (Tested on Python 3.6.7)
	* tqdm
	* argparse


## Run the code

```sh
python filter.py -train <train_file> -score <score_file>
```

The train file contains the translated SQuAD dataset, while the score file indicate translation quality for each qa-pair, generated by running *filter_squad.py* in the *model* folder

After running, 3 files will be returned *result_25.json*, *result_50.json* and *result_75.json* coresponding to 25%, 50% and 75% best translation qas.
